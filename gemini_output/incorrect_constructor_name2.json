Also, the owner may be a contract that triggers a fallback function upon receiving ether, which could lead to a reentrancy attack if the state of the contract is changed after the ether is sent. It is recommended to follow the check-effects-interactions pattern to mitigate reentrancy vulnerabilities.",
