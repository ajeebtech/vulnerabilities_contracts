This can cause a reentrancy vulnerability if the receiving contract calls back into `withdrawAll()` before `credit[msg.sender]` is set to 0. A malicious contract can repeatedly withdraw funds, potentially draining the contract's balance.",

It relies on the require statement on line 13, but a low-level failure in the call may not trigger a revert and bypass the require statement. The intended behavior of reverting when a failure occurs may not be achieved."
