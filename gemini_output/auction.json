        "description": "The contract is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. If the currentFrontrunner's address is set to a contract whose fallback function always reverts, no one will be able to bid higher than the currentBid. This is because the `send` function will always fail, and the entire `bid` transaction will revert due to the `require` statement. An attacker can take advantage of this by becoming the currentFrontrunner with a small bid, and then making their fallback function revert, effectively preventing anyone else from bidding. This can lead to a complete halt of the auction process.",
        "address": 15,
        "debug": "The `require(currentFrontrunner.send(currentBid))` line will cause the transaction to revert if the `send` call fails, for instance, if the `currentFrontrunner` is a contract that always reverts in its fallback function. This will prevent anyone from outbidding the current frontrunner, leading to a denial of service."
