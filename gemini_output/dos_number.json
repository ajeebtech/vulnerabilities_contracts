        "description": "The function `insertNnumbers(uint256,uint256)` can potentially cause a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability. The loop `for(uint i=0;i<numbers;i++)` can execute an unbounded number of times, controlled by the `numbers` parameter. If a user provides a very large value for `numbers`, the execution might consume all available gas, preventing other users from interacting with the contract. Furthermore, within the loop, `array.length += 1;` reallocates memory which can be very expensive. A large number of reallocations combined with numerous writes to the array `array[numElements++] = value;` can exhaust the gas limit. This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to make the contract unusable by legitimate users.",
        "address": 9,
        "debug": "The `insertNnumbers` function's loop is unbounded and dependent on external input.  Large values of `numbers` lead to gas exhaustion. Also, the `array.length += 1` in a loop, combined with write operation within the same loop makes it more easier to cause gas exhaustion and thus DoS."
