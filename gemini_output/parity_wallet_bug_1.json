It is advisable to check that the return value of the delegatecall is true, and to ensure that the callee contract is trusted.  The delegatecall return value is not checked. Failure to check the return value means that if the delegatecall fails (e.g. due to an exception, or due to running out of gas), this will not be detected, potentially causing the program to misbehave.",
